  - title: "Very Long Title Event That Exceeds Normal Length Limits And Contains Many Words To Test Parameter Handling"
    cron: "0 11 * * 3"
    description: "This is an extremely long description that contains many characters to test the handling of long parameter values in the application. It includes multiple sentences and should generate a substantial amount of org-mode content when processed by the generator. The purpose is to ensure that the CLI can handle long parameter values without truncation or errors. This description should be long enough to make the output exceed 500 characters when combined with the title and org-mode formatting."
